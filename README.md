# Getting the Raw Data
This code is designed to run on raw data measurements collected with our benchtop experimental setup. Given that Github is primarly a version control tool for collaborative software development, we have instead elected to store our raw data outside of Github on Zenodo. To run this code on your local machine, you will first need to download the raw data. The following steps will articulate how to do this:
